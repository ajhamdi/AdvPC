# Dynamic Graph CNN for Learning on Point Clouds
We propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures.

## Overview
`DGCNN` is the author's re-implementation of Dynamic Graph CNN, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on point-cloud-related high-level tasks including category classification, semantic segmentation and part segmentation.
